Coordination for U13 grant proposal

call for proposals: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-16-020.html

Problem we are solving:
* The workflow communities work in silos and little discussion happens between different workflow communities
* Workflow systems each compete to do everything and seldom work together to share workflow system components
* Users chose a workflow system for a variety of reasons (some good, some bad) then get locked into their choice
* Workflow systems are each built according to an abstract model, but these models are rarely explicit

Our goal:
* To remove the walls between these silos and organize these community towards building the Workflow Commons (we need to define/agree what we mean by this)  

Initial plan:
* a series of workshops (3?)
  * the first workshop should try to bring together major NIH funded workflows and workflow user communities to
    1. analyse the capability of current workflows and define the taxonomy of the workflows
    2. identify usersâ€™ needs and requirements regarding workflows themselves, workflow interoperability, and data analysis and sharing and their relations to workflows
